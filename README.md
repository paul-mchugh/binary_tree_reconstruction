This problem statement is meant to be accessible to new programmers who do not have that much experience with Data Structures.  If you feel confident that you understand these data structures and concepts feel free to ignore this section

### Trees
Trees are a very useful data structure used in many places within Computer Science.  A **generalized tree** consists of nodes that can have any number of child nodes. There is only one root node which is the node at the "top" of the tree which does not have a parent node.  Otherwise, all nodes have one and only one parent node.  
Below is an example of a binary tree:
